### About
The `taskworkfow.go` file contains code to pull and unpack a container image
using the `devmapper` snaphotter, create a container and execute a task using the
`firecracker-containerd` runtime.

### Building
After checking out the `firecracker-containerd` repo, you can build this
example using the `make examples` command.

### Running
For a basic workflow, without any networking setup, just run the executable
built with the command in the previous section as super user:
```bash
$ sudo /path/to/firecracker-containerd/examples/taskworkflow
```

For a workflow with networking setup for the container, create a tap device
for the VM by following [these instructions](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/network-setup.md).

This creates a tap device named `tap0`, in the local `172.16.0.1/24` subnet.
Since the example does not rely on a DHCP client running within the VM to
initialize the network interface, `gw` flag should be used to
specify the gateway value.

The following example sets:
* The IP address (CIDR) to `172.16.0.2/24`
* The gateway IP address to `172.16.0.1`

** NOTE: This example will not work if you're running more than 1 container
on a host at the same time **

Now, run the example by passing the `-ip` argument:
```bash
$ sudo /path/to/firecracker-containerd/examples/taskworkflow -ip 172.16.0.2/24 \
    -gw 172.16.0.1
```

You should see output similar to this:
